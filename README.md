..Search Bar

One paragraph of project description goes here. Explain what your application does, its main features, and what problems it solves. For example, this application allows users to search for information dynamically within a dataset displayed on a webpage. When a user types any name in the search bar, all related data appears on the page, enhancing the user experience by providing immediate and relevant results.


......... Built With

- **React**: The web framework used for building the user interface.
- **Redux**: Employed for managing the application's state, making it easier to keep track of user inputs and search results across the app.
- **Material-UI**: A UI toolkit that provides React components for faster and easier web development, used here to design a visually appealing and responsive interface.



.....Dynamic Search

- The application includes a dynamic search feature that allows users to find specific entries quickly. 
- As users type in the search bar, the application filters the data in real-time, displaying only the entries that match the search criteria.
- This feature is particularly useful for navigating large sets of data, enabling users to find the information they need without having to scroll through irrelevant content.
